# Basic Bar Charts
Bar charts are a common and important type of plot. Bokeh makes it simple to create all sorts of stacked or nested bar charts, 
and to deal with categorical data in general.

The example below shows a simple bar chart created using the ```vbar``` method for drawing vertical bars. 
(There is a corresponding ```hbar``` for horizontal bars.) We also set a few plot properties to make the chart look nicer, 
see chapter \[Styling and Theming](02 - Styling and Theming.ipynb) for information about visual properties.  

``` Python
# Here is a list of categorical values (or factors)
fruits = ['Apples', 'Pears', 'Nectarines', 'Plums', 'Grapes', 'Strawberries']

# Set the x_range to the list of categories above
p = figure(x_range=fruits, plot_height=250, title="Fruit Counts")

# Categorical values can also be used as coordinates
p.vbar(x=fruits, top=[5, 3, 4, 2, 4, 6], width=0.9)

# Set some properties to make the plot look better
p.xgrid.grid_line_color = None
p.y_range.start = 0

show(p)
```  
When we want to create a plot with a categorical range, we pass the ordered list of categorical values to ```figure```, 
e.g. ```x_range=['a', 'b', 'c']```. In the plot above, we passed the list of fruits as ```x_range```, and we can see those refelected as the x-axis.

The vbar glyph method takes an x location for the center of the bar, a ```top``` and ```bottom``` (which defaults to 0), and a ```width```. 
When we are using a categorical range as we are here, each category implicitly has width of 1, 
so setting ```width=0.9``` as we have done here makes the bars shrink away from each other. (Another option would be to add some padding to the range.)
