In this chapter we will learn how to configure various visual aspects of our plots, and how to find out more about what can be configured.  

# Imports and Setup  
First, let's make the standard imports  

``` Python  
from bokeh.io import output_notebook, show
from bokeh.plotting import figure   
output_notebook()
```  
Before we get started, it's useful to describe how colors and properties are specified in Bokeh.

## Colors
There are many places where you may need to specify colors. Bokeh can accept colors in a variety of different ways:

- any of the [140 named HTML/CSS colors](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp), e.g ```'green'```, ```'indigo'```
- an RGB(A) hex value, e.g., ```'#FF0000'```, ```'#44444444'```
- a 3-tuple of integers _(r,g,b)_ between 0 and 255
- a 4-tuple of _(r,g,b,a)_ where _r, g, b_ are integers between 0 and 255 and a is a floating point value between 0 and 1  
## Properties
Regardless of how a Bokeh plot is created, styling the visual aspects of the plot can always be accomplished by setting attributes on the Bokeh objects 
that comprise the resulting plot. Visual properties come in three kinds: line, fill, and text properties. 
For full information with code and examples see the Styling [Visual Properties](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html) section 
of the user guide.

## Line Properties
Set the visual appearance of lines. The most common are ```line_color```, ```line_alpha```, ```line_width``` and ```line_dash```.

## Fill Properties
Set the visual appearance of filled areas: ```fill_color``` and ```fill_alpha```.

## Text Properties
Set the visual appearance of lines of text. The most common are ```text_font```, ```text_font_size```, ```text_color```, and ```text_alpha```.

---  

Sometimes a prefix is used with property names, e.g. to distinguish between different line properties on the same object, or to give a more meaningful name. 
For example, to set the line width of the plot outline, you would say ```myplot.outline_line_width = 2```.  

# Plots
Many top-level attributes of plots (outline, border, etc.) can be configured. See the [Plots](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#plots) 
section of the styling guide for full information.

Here is an example that tweaks the plot outline:  
``` Python
# create a new plot with a title
p = figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=400)
p.outline_line_width = 7
p.outline_line_alpha = 0.3
p.outline_line_color = "navy"

p.circle([1,2,3,4,5], [2,5,8,2,7], size=10)

show(p)
```

# Glyphs
It's also possible to style the visual properties of glyphs (see the [Glyphs](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#glyphs) 
section of the styling guide for more information). 
When using bokeh.plotting this is often done when calling the glyph methods:

```p.circle(line_color="red", fill_alpha=0.2, ...)```  

But it is also possible to set these properties directly on glyph objects. 
Glyph objects are found on ```GlyphRenderer``` objects, which are returned by the ```Plot.add_glyph``` and ```bokeh.plotting``` glyph methods like 
```circle```, ```rect```, etc. 
Let's look at an example:  
``` Python 
p = figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=400)

# keep a reference to the returned GlyphRenderer
r = p.circle([1,2,3,4,5], [2,5,8,2,7])

r.glyph.size = 50
r.glyph.fill_alpha = 0.2
r.glyph.line_color = "firebrick"
r.glyph.line_dash = [5, 1]
r.glyph.line_width = 2

show(p)
```  

## Selection and non-selection visuals
You can also control how glyphs look when there are selections involved. The set of "selected" points is displayed according to the optional 
```.selection_glyph``` property of a ```GlyphRenderer```:

```r.selection_glyph = Circle(fill_alpha=1, fill_color="firebrick", line_color=None) ```  

When there is a non-empty selection, the set of "unselected" points is displayed according to the optional ```.nonselection_glyph``` property of a ```GlyphRenderer```:

```r.nonselection_glyph = Circle(fill_alpha=0.2, fill_color="grey", line_color=None) ```  

When using the ```bokeh.plotting``` interface, it is easier to pass these visual properties to the glyph methods as shown below. 
The glyph method will create the selection or nonselection glyphs and attach them to the renderer for you.

``` Python  
p = figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=400, tools="tap", title="Select a circle")
renderer = p.circle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 5, 8, 2, 7], size=50,

                    # set visual properties for selected glyphs
                    selection_color="firebrick",

                    # set visual properties for non-selected glyphs
                    nonselection_fill_alpha=0.2,
                    nonselection_fill_color="grey",
                    nonselection_line_color="firebrick",
                    nonselection_line_alpha=1.0)

show(p)
```  

It is also possible to specify the visual appearance of glyphs when they are "inspected", e.g. by a hover tool. 
This is accomplished by setting an optional ```hover_glyph``` on the glyph renderer:

```r.hover_glyph = Circle(fill_alpha=1, fill_color="firebrick", line_color=None) ```  

Or if using ```bokeh.plotting``` glyph methods, by passing ```hover_fill_alpha```, etc. to the glyph method. 
Lets look at an example that works together with a ```HoverTool``` configured for "hline" hit-testing.  

``` Python 
from bokeh.models.tools import HoverTool
from bokeh.sampledata.glucose import data

subset = data.loc['2010-10-06']

x, y = subset.index.to_series(), subset['glucose']

# Basic plot setup
p = figure(width=600, height=300, x_axis_type="datetime", title='Hover over points')

p.line(x, y, line_dash="4 4", line_width=1, color='gray')

cr = p.circle(x, y, size=20,
              fill_color="grey", hover_fill_color="firebrick",
              fill_alpha=0.05, hover_alpha=0.3,
              line_color=None, hover_line_color="white")

p.add_tools(HoverTool(tooltips=None, renderers=[cr], mode='hline'))

show(p)
```

# Axes  
Next we will take a look at [stlying of Axes](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#axes).

To style axes, you first must get ahold of ```Axis``` objects. 
The simplest way is to use some convenience methods on ```Plot```: ```axis```, ```xaxis```, and ```yaxis```. 
These methods return lists of axis objects:

```
>>> p.xaxis
\[<bokeh.models.axes.LinearAxis at 0x106fa2390>\]
```  

However, you can set properties on all the elements of the list as if it was a single object:

```
p.xaxis.axis_label = "Temperature"
p.axis.major_label_text_color = "orange"
```  

These are referred to as "splattable" lists, and tab completion works on them as well.  

## Axis properties  

Axes objects have many configurable properties that afford control over most visual aspects of an axis. These can be grouped by function according to prefix:

- axis [line properties](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#line-properties) e.g ```axis_line_width```
- axis_label [text properties](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#text-properties) e.g. ```axis_label_text_color```, as well as ```axis_label_standoff```
- major_label [text properties](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#text-properties) e.g. ```major_label_text_font_size```, as well as ```major_label_orientation```
- major_tick [line_properties](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#line-properties) e.g. ```major_tick_line_dash```, as well as ```major_tick_in``` and ```major_tick_out```
- minor_tick [line properties](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#line-properties) e.g. ```minor_tick_line_width```, as well as ```minor_tick_in``` and ```minor_tick_out```

As a simple first case, let's change the orientation of the major tick labels on both axes of a plot:  

``` Python
from math import pi

p = figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=400)
p.x([1,2,3,4,5], [2,5,8,2,7], size=10, line_width=2)

p.xaxis.major_label_orientation = pi/4
p.yaxis.major_label_orientation = "vertical"

show(p)
```  
The next example shows customizations on several of the different Axis properties at once:  

``` Python
p = figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=400)
p.asterisk([1,2,3,4,5], [2,5,8,2,7], size=12, color="olive")

# change just some things about the x-axes
p.xaxis.axis_label = "Temp"
p.xaxis.axis_line_width = 3
p.xaxis.axis_line_color = "red"

# change just some things about the y-axes
p.yaxis.axis_label = "Pressure"
p.yaxis.major_label_text_color = "orange"
p.yaxis.major_label_orientation = "vertical"

# change things on all axes
p.axis.minor_tick_in = -3
p.axis.minor_tick_out = 6

show(p)
```  

## Configuring tick labels  
All Bokeh axes have a ```formatter``` property, whose value is a ```TickFormatter``` object that Bokeh uses to format the ticks displayed by that axis. Bokeh will configure default tick formatters for numeric, datetime, or categotical axes. But often we would like to customize the appearance of tick labels. This can be accomplished by changing properties on the default formatter that Bokeh chooses, or by replacing the formatter with a new type entirely.

Let's first look at changing the properties of a default formatter. The default datetime formatter is configured to show _month/day_ when the axis is on the scale of days. If would like the also always show the year, we can change the ```days``` property to a format that includes the year, as done below.  

``` Python
from math import pi
from bokeh.sampledata.glucose import data

week = data.loc['2010-10-01':'2010-10-08']

p = figure(x_axis_type="datetime", title="Glocose Range", plot_height=350, plot_width=800)
p.xaxis.formatter.days = '%m/%d/%Y'
p.xaxis.major_label_orientation = pi/3

p.line(week.index, week.glucose)

show(p)
```  

See the reference guide entry for [DatetimeTickFormatter](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/models/formatters.html#bokeh.models.formatters.DatetimeTickFormatter)
to see other properties that can be updated.

In addition to the tick formatters that Bokeh will use by default, there are others such as the [NumeralTickFormatter](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#numeraltickformatter) that we can configure explicitly. 
The example below shows how to set a formatter on each axis.  

``` Python
from bokeh.models import NumeralTickFormatter

p = figure(plot_height=300, plot_width=800)
p.circle([1,2,3,4,5], [2,5,8,2,7], size=10)

p.xaxis.formatter = NumeralTickFormatter(format="0.0%")
p.yaxis.formatter = NumeralTickFormatter(format="$0.00")

show(p)
```  
Try experimenting with the format argument and re-execute the cell above.

There are many other possibilities for controlling tick formatting, including the possibility of supplying a JavaScript snippet to perform arbitrary formatting in the browser. See the [Tick Label Formats](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#tick-label-formats) for more details.

It is also possible to customize where ticks will be drawn. See the [Tick Locations](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#tick-locations) section of the User's Guide for more information.
