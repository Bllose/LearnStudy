## Basic _Plotting_  
> **plot**  
> _verb_(MARK)  
> \[T\]  
> to mark or draw something on a piece of paper or a map  
> to make marks to show the position, movement, or development of something, usually in the form of lines or curves between a series of points on a map or piece of paper.  

### Imports and Setup
When using the ``` bokeh.plotting ``` interface, there are a few common imports:
- Use the ``` figure ``` function to create new plot objects to work with.
- Call the functions ``` output file ``` or ```output notebook ``` to tell Bokeh how to display or save output.
- Excute ``` show ``` and ``` save ``` to display or save plots and layout.  
``` Python
import numpy as np # we will use this later, so import it now

from bokeh.io import output_notebook, show
from bokeh.plotting import figure
```  
In this case, we are in the Jupyter notebook, so we will call ```output_notebook()``` below. We only need to call this **once**, and all subsequent calls to show() will display inline in the notebook.  
``` Python
output_notebook()
```  
If everything is working, you should see a Bokeh logo and a message like _"BokehJS 1.4.0 successfully loaded."_ as the output.  

This notebook uses Bokeh sample data. If you haven't downloaded it already, this can be downloaded by running the following:  
``` Python
import bokeh.sampledata
bokeh.sampledata.download()
```   
```

### Scatter Plots  
> **Scatter**  
> _verb_(COVER)  
> to cover a surface with things that are far apart and in no particular arrangement  
>   

Bokeh can draw many types of visual shapes (called _glyphs_), including lines, bars, patches, hex tiles and more. One of the most common visualization tasks is to draw a scatter plot of data using small marker glyphs to represent each point.

In this section you will see how to use Bokeh's various marker glyphs to create simple scatter plots.  

**Glyph**  
> a small symbol  
> 
The basic outline is :  
- create a blank figure: ```p = figure(...)```  
- call a glyph method such as ``` p.circle ``` on the figure
- ```show``` the figure

Execute the cell below to create a small scatter plot with circle glyphs:  
``` Python
# create a new plot with default tools, using figure
p = figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=400)

# add a circle renderer with x and y coordinates, size, color, and alpha
p.circle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 5], size=15, line_color="navy", fill_color="orange", fill_alpha=0.5)

show(p) # show the results
```
 
**Line Plots**  
``` Python
# create a new plot (with a title) using figure
p = figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=400, title="My Line Plot")

# add a line renderer
p.line([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 5], line_width=2)

show(p) # show the results
```

## Styling and Theming  
**Colors**  
There are many places where you may need to specify colors. Bokeh can accept colors in a variety of different ways:  
- any of the 140 named HTML/CSS colors, e.g ```'green'```, ```'indigo'```  
- an RGB(A) hex value, e.g., ```'#FF0000'```, ```'#44444444'```  
- a _3-tuple_ of integers (r,g,b) between 0 and 255
- a _4-tuple_ of (r,g,b,a) where r,g,b are integers between 0 and 255 and _a_ is a floating point value between 0 and 1
